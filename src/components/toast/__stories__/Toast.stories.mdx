# Toast

[Toasts](?path=/story/components-toast--success) are shown as a floating box typically in the top right of the page. They can optionally be displayed on other edges of the screen (top-left, top-center, bottom-left, bottom-center, or bottom-right). Toasts provide limited space for content, and therefore the content must be short and concise, providing immediate feedback in response to a user action or informing users of a process that the app has performed or will perform. Disappear automatically or can be dismissed by the user.
